# Typie - key launcher
> The fastest, fuzzy search, open source key launcher around

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/typie/typie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/typie/typie)

## Getting Started
Just fork it to your dev machine and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/typie/typie.git

# install dependencies
yarn
```

 [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is `npm` on steroids -> use it, don't be lazy.

```bash
yarn dev
```

> compile source code and create webpack output
```bash
yarn compile
```

> `yarn compile` & create build with electron-builder
```bash
yarn dist
```

> `yarn compile` & create unpacked build with electron-builder
```bash

```
